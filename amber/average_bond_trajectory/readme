To get table of rmsd's and bond length for the average structure(averaged over all asymmetric units) from several equilibration steps:

1. edit AvgBond.py for the specific bond you want to look at
2. edit AvgBond.sh line 141 for the set of structures you want to analyze.
3. run AvgBond.sh

	

To get a bond for each of the 12 ASU's in just one frame (like equil30):
1. edit BondPerASU - SC_TRAJECTORY is the stucture it'll work on, at bottom you have cpptraj scripts to edit specific bond
2. run BondPerASU.sh
	

BondPerASU2.sh is used on RevSym trajectiories (not just single frames like from equil30.rst7 to get an average structure first.

Apr 2013: To prepare the publication table (Table1.dat)

1. ran ctraj_rmsd and ctraj_bond (created by AvgBond.py) on:
