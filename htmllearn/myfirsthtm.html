    <h1>My Week 13 Project</h1>
    <h2>HTML is fun!</h2>
    <p>
        I have been using <a href="http://www.codeyear.com" target="_blank">CodeYear</a> to learn to code in HTML so that I will be able to make my own web-pages without having to use expensive WYSIWYG software!
    </p>
    <h3>I have learned many things.</h3>
    <p>
        I now have an overview of HTML and how it plays a huge role in websites.  I have looked at opening and closing tags, head, title and body tags, header tags, how to make links, and how to include images in my pages!
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm now completing my first project using my new-found knowledge and skills!
    </p>
    <h2>I can't wait to learn CSS!</h2>
    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) will be of great use when learning to lay out and format the look of my web page.  I am looking forward to learning this once I have completed my HTML course
