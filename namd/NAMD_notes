This is a folder to test running hairpin in namd. 

The test structures (equil30.rst7 and topo.prmtop) are of the equilibrated 2oueIb system which was equilibrated and obtained correct volume on kraken on 29.VIII.2011 and is found in ~/York/hairpin/equil9x/2oueIb_ProdEquil.

The prmtop is created with the "set default FlexibleWater on" settings in tleap. The tleap script is ~/York/hairpin/2oue/prep/rnatleap_namd. Ran "tleap -f rnatleap_namd >tleap.out". Copied the resulting "2oueIb_namd.prmtop to this folder as topo.prmtop. Created pdb file from this topo and the equil30.rst7 with ambpdb.

If scee and scnb fields are present in the prmtop erase them.(not sure, if not using default values 1.2 and 2.0???)

For the cellBasisVector settings use matlab thus:
gdim=[93.2745112  93.2745112 131.2535338  90.0000000  90.0000000 120.0000000] (last line from restart file)
gdim(4:6)=gdim(4:6)*pi/180
[a,b,c]=CompXfrmPawel(gdim)
You need b:
b =

   93.2745  -46.6373    0.0000
         0   80.7781    0.0000
         0         0  131.2535
which gives:
cellBasisVector1      93.2745    0.         0.
cellBasisVector2     -46.6373   80.7781     0.
cellBasisVector3       0.        0.       131.2535

For the cell origin use in vmd console:
set sel [atomselect top all]
measure center $sel (this is the value you plug into the cellOrigin field for namd)
$sel moveby [vecscale -1 [measure center $sel] ] (this last line is to move the system so that the center is at 0,0,0)


#############
To run:
MPIR=/cottus/home/pjanowsk/bin/NAMD_2.8_Source/Linux-x86_64-g++/charmrun
EXE=/cottus/home/pjanowsk/bin/NAMD_2.8_Source/Linux-x86_64-g++/namd2
NP=48

$MPIR ++local +p${NP} $EXE inputfile.inp


#########
To analyze output:
vmd topo.prmtop md1.dcd
namdcheck.sh in OutputAnalysis/
[pjanowsk@r101c namd4]$ xmgrace -block tmp.txt -bxy 2:13	temp


###
For KRAKEN: each folder should contain:
.rst7
.prmtop 
OUT.settings
NPT.settings
PME.settings
.in file (for namd)
.coord
.xsd
.vel 
kraken_namd.sh
krakenMaster.sh

#####
Very important to remember: for the first run the 
	bincoordinates
	extendedsystem
	binvelocities
flags have to commented out and then for the subsequent runs the must be turned on. Otherwise you will always restart from the initial amber rst7. 

To check, grep the log output file from namd for 

pjanowsk@krakow:~/pnet/York/hairpin/hairpinXtal/2oueIb_ProdEquil$ grep "BINARY COORDINATES" ./*log
./10.log:Info: BINARY COORDINATES     md9.coor
./11.log:Info: BINARY COORDINATES     md10.coor
./12.log:Info: BINARY COORDINATES     md11.coor
./13.log:Info: BINARY COORDINATES     md12.coor
./14.log:Info: BINARY COORDINATES     md13.coor

If you don't get these lines, it means it restarted from the amber rst7
